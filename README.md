# RULES

- Each player starts with four cards face down in their hand. Every card has a value, and the aim of the game is to have a hand with cards that sum to the lowest value. Ace is worth 1, 2 is worth 2, and so on. Face cards (J,Q,K) are worth 10, and
Jokers are worth 0. 

- The game ends when a player thinks they have the lowest hand and, at the end of their turn, calls "Dutch". Other players then get one more turn, and then all cards are revealed.

- At the start of the game, the player gets to look at any combination of their starting cards by holding down the keys [1,2,3,4], and the other players get to look at their corresponding cards.

- Players take turns. On each turn you can draw a card either from the draw pile or the discard pile. However you can't take a discarded face card.

- You can look at the cards you draw, and you can either discard it directly or swap it with one of the cards in your hand, and discard the swapped card. To swap it with a card in hand, simply drag the drawn card onto the card to be discarded.

- If at any point you have a card with the same value as the top card in the discard pile, you can play it directly from your hand, decreasing the number of cards in your hand by one. If you draw a card with the same value as the top card in the discard pile and discard it directly, you can discard an extra card from you hand.

- Face cards have abilities that trigger when you play them. A King gives an opponent an extra card in their hand. A Queen lets you look at any card in anyone's hand by holding down right click on it. A Jack lets you either look at any card, or swap one of any two player's cards the way you could swap around any two of your own cards. If you have any unplayed abilities, they will be shown in the bottom left corner.
