##RULES

Each player starts with four cards face down in their hand. Every card has a value, and the aim of the game is to have a hand with cards that sum to the lowest value. Ace is worth 1, 2 is worth 2, and so on. Face cards (J,Q,K) are worth 10, and
Jokers are worth 0. 

The game ends when a player thinks they have the lowest hand and, at the end of their turn, calls "Dutch", where other players get one more turn, and then all cards are revealed.

Players take turns. On each turn you can draw a card either from the draw pile or the discard pile. However you can't take a discarded face card. Since there are no discarded cards, let's draw from the draw pile.

You can look at the cards you draw, and you can either discard it directly or swap it with one of the cards in your hand, and discard the swapped card. Since it's nice to know what cards you have, let's swap this with one of our cards.

If at any point you have a card with the same value as the top card in the discard pile, you can play it directly from your hand, decreasing the number of cards in your hand by one. If you draw a card with the same value as the top card in the discard pile and discard it directly, you can discard an extra card from you hand.

Face cards have abilities that trigger when you play them. A King gives an opponent an extra card in their hand. A Queen lets you look at any card in anyone's hand. A Jack lets you either look at any card, or swap one of any two player's cards.
